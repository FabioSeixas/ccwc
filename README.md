# ccwc in Rust
Coding Challenges - wc tool

## Next steps

In this step your goal is to support being able to read from standard input if no filename is specified. 
If youâ€™ve done it right your output should match this:

> cat test.txt | ccwc -l 
    7137


## Improvements as a way to learn

1. Define and Implement an object (Struct) to deal with user inputs. 
- Methods to validate and send to the correct flow according to inputs.
- Use std::fs to check if file exists

2. Define and Implement an object to deal with core flow
- file read
- buffer parse
- bytes count
- etc...
